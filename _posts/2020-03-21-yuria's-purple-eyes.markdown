Many years ago when I was a kid I totally didn't understand _Hokudo No Ken_ (北斗の拳，北斗神拳, Fist of the North Stars). All I knew (and was so happy for) was songs and hero stories. All kids love invincible heros and who better have some tragical old stories, such like happy life is broken by villains so forth.
I also felt great when I saw heros were winning again and again, "to get back what he lost".

Years later I'm never a kid. _Hokudo No Ken_ is still unforgettable. No only for those great songs but also the thoughts which only exist as adults.

This anime is a fairy tale of adults.

# Who's Yuria indeed?
All the goodness of humanity, all the beautiful things in the world. The hope. Or even your own internal peace.

# What does Kenshiro fight for?
The hope that one day people would stop wars, hate, unfairness. The world will return to the state of being clean, origin, innocent and peaceful. You can see such footages in EP1 - "Yuria Forever" (masterpiece) and this "Purple eyes".

Kenshiro (you, and everyone) has been fighting so hard. You fail and fight back again and again. It never stops...
